n our project, we use MongoDB to store a variety of sensor data collected from different IoT devices deployed in the airport environment. For example, one of our collections stores temperature readings from various sensors located throughout the airport. Each document in this collection includes fields such as 'deviceId', 'timestamp', 'temperature', and 'location'. Here is a sample document:
MongoDB's flexible schema allows us to easily add new types of data without altering existing structures. For instance, if we decide to add humidity sensors in the future, we can simply start storing documents with a 'humidity' field in the same collection, without any schema modifications. This flexibility is crucial for handling the diverse and evolving data requirements of our IoT ecosystem.
