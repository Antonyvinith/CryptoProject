'Alternative Approach:f ou have the original public key (pubKey used during encryption), you can directly use it for decryption without needing to reverse this string representation.
In Summary:Directly reversing the 'ciphertextPubKey' string is not feasible due to the way it's constructed and the potential lack of context about the LSB extraction.
